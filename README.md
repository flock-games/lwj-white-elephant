# lwj-white-elephant

This repo serves as a parent for my White Elephant project for the [Learn With Jason Hackathon 10](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/web-dev-challenge-hackathon-s1e10-workshop-woes).

See the studio-elephant repo for my Sanity project and the nuxt-elephant repo for the web app I built.
